There are times when I watch a movie and it stays with me for days; like the ending of Grave of the Fireflies or that dildo scene from Requiem of a Dream. Rime was the dildo to my Requiem. The dead japanese adolescent to my Fireflies. If you happened to play this along with your children, it was meant to make you ugly cry in front of them. Quite possibly changing their perception of you forever.

## SPOILERS

When I first picked up the game, I thought the story revolved around a little boy stranded on an island. Because, of course, the game revolves around me. I'm playing the little boy and therefore it's my story. Not long into the game, I realized that I'm probably no longer alive. It was like a Bruce Willis realization except I'm not an adult in a suit, I'm a wee little boy with a red scarf.

Turns out, what you actually experience in the storyline is all about your father and the stages of grief he goes through in order to make peace with your memory. I'm not going to ruin the ending completely, but I was angry about how the father dealt with the red scarf. Ultimately, this was a fitting way to deal with the end of the story. It also called to attention my own feelings about loss and grief. ((( Insert Ugly Cry Face )))

Some people might find that the ending strips away some of the abstruse symbolism of the game by bringing it into reality. I could understand why the route was taken with the ending because the Creative Director, Raúl Rubio Munárriz, had nearly drowned. That experience paired with the regrets he felt for not having a child became fuel for the soul that became Rime.

The name itself made me think of the poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a poem written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge about an old sailor with tales of supernatural adventures "Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship, Upon a painted ocean."

## YOU MAY NOT UGLY CRY, SO WHAT THEN?

If you're all about the gameplay and not the story line, this game is very easy. It's about 10 hours long and the puzzles aren't revelatory as The Witness or Myst, but they're still fun to play through. There's a feeling of nostalgia that comes from how the characters were styled and the sweeping musical scores, but I think it's because of the familiarity of the surroundings. It feels like the Last Guardian except less frustrating and more intimate. It's worth it to take it out of the Shamepile and play through the game, especially if you enjoyed ICO or Journey. If Rime wasn't influenced by these games, they definitely live in the same realm.
