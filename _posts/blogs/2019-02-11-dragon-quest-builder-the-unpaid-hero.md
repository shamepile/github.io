Like many other premises of lore, Dragon Quest Builder wakes you from a deep slumber, only to give you immense responsibility. It's like being on disability for six months and waking up the next morning to a surprise job at a corporate office. Except, corporate won't pay you. They need your creative talents, but would rather put you through an unpaid internship because it's much easier for them to ask you to do things than put you on payroll. But, don't fear, it's for experience and the corporation... The WORLD... needs you.

Like a company that doesn't pay their interns, the world you wake up to are filled with con artists, lazy people who can't do their jobs (but somehow charm everyone enough to keep them), and passive aggressive folk who "manage." Let's take the character Pippa, for instance. She is the first NPC, but not the last of many, who fit the aforementioned characteristics of employees who inhabit this "World Corporation."

## PIPPA IS A CON ARTIST

Hint Hint. Oh, if only I didn't know how to do things for myself, maybe someone smart enough and creative enough can do it for me. Like build me an entire town. Or get me food. Pippa is a classic Sociopath; unassuming and manipulative. She makes you trust her. Then, in one twisted comment, makes you question your sanity.

Since, you're obviously not in your right mind (and Pippa has convinced you of that) she takes the lead. Pippa lied. She can draw. She can create. She just doesn't want to do the hard shit. Pippa will think for you. Pippa will tell YOU what to build.

Which leads to the next section...

## PIPPA IS LAZY

So wait. The whole time she's been alive, she's never fed herself? How is this possible? Oh, make the Intern get the coffee.... OH, maybe the intern can go berry picking... Or maybe the talented intern can just build an entire kitchen and make some kabobs!

Exasperation with your situation hits, but the truth is, Pippa isn't only fake, she's also lazy. Maybe this whole time, she's been feigning ignorance just so that you have more work to do. You know why she does that? Because you're a sucker who continually does her work for her. You are enabling tyranny.

## PIPPA IS A PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE MANAGER

Now that she's managed to wrap you in a web of deceit, working for mushrooms, and building her vision of a city, Pippa gives herself the right to treat you like you just woke up yesterday. Which is true. You kind of did, but that doesn't make you less talented.

I know,...maybe YOU can build something. Maybe you can stop complaining about food and delegating tasks.

<img src="/img/blog/2019-02-11-dragon-quest-builder-the-unpaid-hero/13.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

No really, Pippa. You can get more stuff. I made a chest, so put some stuff in it yourself.

Like a lot of higher ups, ---

## PIPPA MAKES TERRIBLE DECISIONS

Yes, that's exactly what we need to bring in build a better community. We need strange men who giggle to themselves and stroke enormous books. If you look at the image closely, you can see him stroking his enormous book behind the yellow flag.

## ONWARD, INTERN. ONWARD TO GREATER TASKS

Does this story take a dark turn for the best? Will Pippa ever stop? Will she be ousted once the people recognize her clear plan for dictatorship? It's hard to tell, because all internships come to an end. This one, ended 3 hours into the game. The World Corporation was too much to handle. There were too many things on the to-do-list and way too many "Pippas."
