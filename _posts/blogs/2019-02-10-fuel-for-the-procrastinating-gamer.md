It can be overwhelming to scroll through the screen of unplayed digital games that have been accumulating over the years. Maybe you have an old shame pile of cartridge games that are lost in some closet corner because you lost the console power cord. Maybe your love of TV show binging ensure you don’t have time to play those games you mean to. Every Black Friday, Humble Bundle and Steam Sale just ensure that the shame pile will never go down. But where do you start? That question will not be answered here. Tune into our first podcast to find our suggestions. Instead, I am going to suggest some healthier drink/food options to get you through your play session.

It really can be easy to reach for sugary sodas or carb loaded snacks when you are putting hours into a game. I’m got as much cred as a doctor as Super Mario does (seriously who goes to a plumber for pills? Sounds shifty), so don’t rely too much on my advice.

1. **Water** Staying hydrated is key to not passing out and falling out of your chair onto the floor (which is lava)
2. **Coffee** If you are trying to stay alert, at least you can control the amount of sugar that goes into it.
3. **Baby carrots** If it was good enough for you at age 6, it’s good enough for you now. Broccoli or any other crunchy veggie with guacamole might help you get that satisfying crunch instead of reaching for the pringles can (your hand is going to get stuck trying to reach for the chips anyway. Let’s avoid the horrifying ordeal)
4. **Burgers and fries** Seriously can still be an option. If you are craving meat when slicing beasts up in the fields of Hyrule, stick to lean options like 96% lean beef or bison. Using an air fryer to make French fries can reduce the amount of oil you are cooking with while still maintaining that glorious fried flavor.
5. **Pizza** You can bake your own with olive oil instead of tomato sauce. Goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms are some healthy topping options.

**So those are some healthy suggestions to get you through your play session. Now excuse me, I think my Postmates order is here. Mmmm bacon fries, mac and cheese, fried chicken and Mountain Dew.**
