Find out if these games are good enough for you and your friends before spending your cold hard cash. As you go through this blog, you'll notice a trend in my game selection. For most of this collection (with a few exceptions), I've pulled together a list of games with a low cost to high replayability ratio. This was done with the intention of maximizing enjoyment for you and your friends while keeping your money where it belongs, in your wallet. That's why I leaned towards games that are procedurally generated with some sort of progression system and a timeless artstyle for almost infinite replayability.

Supergiants first multiplayer game does not disappoint. Pyre uses an impressive visual style with memorable voice-over work and ear melting music. Beyond the surface features, Pyre is a crossroad between fantasy adventure, action RPG, and graphic novel. Teams are placed at opposite ends of a small map, each with a flame. Your goal is to grab a ball of energy, throw it into the enemy flame until the enemy team's pyre has been extinguished.
