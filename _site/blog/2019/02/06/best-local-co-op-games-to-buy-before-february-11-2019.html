      <p>Find out if these games are good enough for you and your friends before spending your cold hard cash. As you go through this blog, you’ll notice a trend in my game selection. For most of this collection (with a few exceptions), I’ve pulled together a list of games with a low cost to high replayability ratio.</p>

<p>This was done with the intention of maximizing enjoyment for you and your friends while keeping your money where it belongs, in your wallet. That’s why I leaned towards games that are procedurally generated with some sort of progression system and a timeless artstyle for almost infinite replayability.</p>

<p>Supergiants first multiplayer game does not disappoint. Pyre uses an impressive visual style with memorable voice-over work and ear melting music.

Your goal is to grab a ball of energy, throw it into the enemy flame until the enemy team’s pyre has been extinguished.</p>
