			 "content": "There are times when I watch a movie and it stays with me for days; like the ending of Grave of the Fireflies or that dildo scene from Requiem of a Dream. Rime was the dildo to my Requiem. The dead japanese adolescent to my Fireflies. If you happened to play this along with your children, it was meant to make you ugly cry in front of them. Quite possibly changing their perception of you forever.SPOILERSWhen I first picked up the game, I thought the story revolved around a little boy stranded on an island. Because, of course, the game revolves around me. I’m playing the little boy and therefore it’s my story. Not long into the game, I realized that I’m probably no longer alive. It was like a Bruce Willis realization except I’m not an adult in a suit, I’m a wee little boy with a red scarf.Turns out, what you actually experience in the storyline is all about your father and the stages of grief he goes through in order to make peace with your memory. I’m not going to ruin the ending completely, but I was angry about how the father dealt with the red scarf. Ultimately, this was a fitting way to deal with the end of the story. It also called to attention my own feelings about loss and grief. ((( Insert Ugly Cry Face )))Some people might find that the ending strips away some of the abstruse symbolism of the game by bringing it into reality. I could understand why the route was taken with the ending because the Creative Director, Raúl Rubio Munárriz, had nearly drowned. That experience paired with the regrets he felt for not having a child became fuel for the soul that became Rime.The name itself made me think of the poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a poem written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge about an old sailor with tales of supernatural adventures “Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship, Upon a painted ocean.”YOU MAY NOT UGLY CRY, SO WHAT THEN?If you’re all about the gameplay and not the story line, this game is very easy. It’s about 10 hours long and the puzzles aren’t revelatory as The Witness or Myst, but they’re still fun to play through. There’s a feeling of nostalgia that comes from how the characters were styled and the sweeping musical scores, but I think it’s because of the familiarity of the surroundings. It feels like the Last Guardian except less frustrating and more intimate. It’s worth it to take it out of the Shamepile and play through the game, especially if you enjoyed ICO or Journey. If Rime wasn’t influenced by these games, they definitely live in the same realm.",

			 "content": "AND SO OUR HERO HAS A JOBLike many other premises of lore, Dragon Quest Builder wakes you from a deep slumber, only to give you immense responsibility. It’s like being on disability for six months and waking up the next morning to a surprise job at a corporate office. Except, corporate won’t pay you. They need your creative talents, but would rather put you through an unpaid internship because it’s much easier for them to ask you to do things than put you on payroll. But, don’t fear, it’s for experience and the corporation… The WORLD… needs you.Like a company that doesn’t pay their interns, the world you wake up to are filled with con artists, lazy people who can’t do their jobs (but somehow charm everyone enough to keep them), and passive aggressive folk who “manage.” Let’s take the character Pippa, for instance. She is the first NPC, but not the last of many, who fit the aforementioned characteristics of employees who inhabit this “World Corporation.”PIPPA IS A CON ARTISTHint Hint. Oh, if only I didn’t know how to do things for myself, maybe someone smart enough and creative enough can do it for me. Like build me an entire town. Or get me food. Pippa is a classic Sociopath; unassuming and manipulative. She makes you trust her. Then, in one twisted comment, makes you question your sanity.Since, you’re obviously not in your right mind (and Pippa has convinced you of that) she takes the lead. Pippa lied. She can draw. She can create. She just doesn’t want to do the hard shit. Pippa will think for you. Pippa will tell YOU what to build.Which leads to the next section…PIPPA IS LAZYSo wait. The whole time she’s been alive, she’s never fed herself? How is this possible? Oh, make the Intern get the coffee…. OH, maybe the intern can go berry picking… Or maybe the talented intern can just build an entire kitchen and make some kabobs!Exasperation with your situation hits, but the truth is, Pippa isn’t only fake, she’s also lazy. Maybe this whole time, she’s been feigning ignorance just so that you have more work to do. You know why she does that? Because you’re a sucker who continually does her work for her. You are enabling tyranny.PIPPA IS A PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE MANAGERNow that she’s managed to wrap you in a web of deceit, working for mushrooms, and building her vision of a city, Pippa gives herself the right to treat you like you just woke up yesterday. Which is true. You kind of did, but that doesn’t make you less talented.I know,…maybe YOU can build something. Maybe you can stop complaining about food and delegating tasks.No really, Pippa. You can get more stuff. I made a chest, so put some stuff in it yourself.Like a lot of higher ups, —PIPPA MAKES TERRIBLE DECISIONSYes, that’s exactly what we need to bring in build a better community. We need strange men who giggle to themselves and stroke enormous books. If you look at the image closely, you can see him stroking his enormous book behind the yellow flag.ONWARD, INTERN. ONWARD TO GREATER TASKSDoes this story take a dark turn for the best? Will Pippa ever stop? Will she be ousted once the people recognize her clear plan for dictatorship? It’s hard to tell, because all internships come to an end. This one, ended 3 hours into the game. The World Corporation was too much to handle. There were too many things on the to-do-list and way too many “Pippas.”",

			 "content": "It can be overwhelming to scroll through the screen of unplayed digital games that have been accumulating over the years. Maybe you have an old shame pile of cartridge games that are lost in some closet corner because you lost the console power cord. Maybe your love of TV show binging ensure you don’t have time to play those games you mean to. Every Black Friday, Humble Bundle and Steam Sale just ensure that the shame pile will never go down. But where do you start? That question will not be answered here. Tune into our first podcast to find our suggestions. Instead, I am going to suggest some healthier drink/food options to get you through your play session.It really can be easy to reach for sugary sodas or carb loaded snacks when you are putting hours into a game. I’m got as much cred as a doctor as Super Mario does (seriously who goes to a plumber for pills? Sounds shifty), so don’t rely too much on my advice.  Water Staying hydrated is key to not passing out and falling out of your chair onto the floor (which is lava)  Coffee If you are trying to stay alert, at least you can control the amount of sugar that goes into it.  Baby carrots If it was good enough for you at age 6, it’s good enough for you now. Broccoli or any other crunchy veggie with guacamole might help you get that satisfying crunch instead of reaching for the pringles can (your hand is going to get stuck trying to reach for the chips anyway. Let’s avoid the horrifying ordeal)  Burgers and fries Seriously can still be an option. If you are craving meat when slicing beasts up in the fields of Hyrule, stick to lean options like 96% lean beef or bison. Using an air fryer to make French fries can reduce the amount of oil you are cooking with while still maintaining that glorious fried flavor.  Pizza You can bake your own with olive oil instead of tomato sauce. Goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms are some healthy topping options.So those are some healthy suggestions to get you through your play session. Now excuse me, I think my Postmates order is here. Mmmm bacon fries, mac and cheese, fried chicken and Mountain Dew.",

			 "content": "Find out if these games are good enough for you and your friends before spending your cold hard cash. As you go through this blog, you’ll notice a trend in my game selection. For most of this collection (with a few exceptions), I’ve pulled together a list of games with a low cost to high replayability ratio.This was done with the intention of maximizing enjoyment for you and your friends while keeping your money where it belongs, in your wallet. That’s why I leaned towards games that are procedurally generated with some sort of progression system and a timeless artstyle for almost infinite replayability.CrawlGrab your friends and battle through randomly generated dungeons. Become horrid beasts and control traps to kill the hero. Race to buy weapons and reach level 10 so you can kill the boss, before your friends kill you!Stick Fight: The GameYou don’t have to be a great gamer to enjoy this fighting game. A physics-based combat system where you punch, kick, slice, and shoot to take out your aggression the old fashion way. By beating your friends in video games until they run home crying to their mommy. With over 100 interactive levels and procedural generated animations, you’ll never have a dull moment.For The KingA low-poly procedurally generated table top strategy game with a multiclass progression system. Travel the world together, voyage the seas, explore dungeons, win challenges, discover loot, avoid traps, and beat the odds in the unforgiving lands of Fahrul.PyreSupergiants first multiplayer game does not disappoint. Pyre uses an impressive visual style with memorable voice-over work and ear melting music. Beyond the surface features, Pyre is a crossroad between fantasy adventure, action RPG, and graphic novel. Teams are placed at opposite ends of a small map, each with a flame. Your goal is to grab a ball of energy, throw it into the enemy flame until the enemy team’s pyre has been extinguished.Magicka 2If you love light hearted humor that enjoys making fun of itself, than you’ll love playing this stupid storyline. Play with your imaginary friends, combine real magic, and bear witness to special effects like those only seen in this video game. Progress through not the seven kingdoms, kill not vampires, and read words until your heart’s content. Overall it’s a pretty fun games that is moderately difficult yet easy enough for casual gamers to enjoy.Moon HuntersA beautiful 2D role play game, with an amazing soundtrack that lets you write your own adventure. Explore a randomly generated Mesopotamia-inspired world with your friends, in a Zelda / Diablo hybrid of sorts. Each player has unique powers and abilities that you can use to help each other while you explore the world, survive off the land, and play the many quest in the game.N++A seizure inducing minimalist platformer that ends friendships with its local competitive multiplayer. Use the built-in level editor with 50+ color schemes and what feels like an infinite number of templates. This platformer give super meatboy a run for its money.CupheadUnless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 2 years, you heard about Cuphead. The weird, beautifully drawn shooter game designed to look like an early Walt Disney cartoon with a jazz soundtrack to match. It’s on sale right now, so if you haven’t bought it, you probably should.Street of RogueA procedurally generated cities game that uses RPG elements in order to progress the player, so there is a sense of accomplishment after missions. Build up special character traits, items, and the environment with your friends in this couch multiplayer rogue-lite action RPG.ClashlandsPrepare for the story of a lifetime, with a bad guy, a bunch of quest, a purple hero, and it’s gender neutral friend. Kill local wildlife to acquire their parts for your crafting, then turn their own parts against them. Sew their skin into armor, grind their bones into weapons, and turn their babies against their former family by having them fight for their new mothers enjoyment.",
