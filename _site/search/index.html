			 "content": "It can be overwhelming to scroll through the screen of unplayed digital games that have been accumulating over the years. Maybe you have an old shame pile of cartridge games that are lost in some closet corner because you lost the console power cord. Maybe your love of TV show binging ensure you donâ€™t have time to play those games you mean to. Every Black Friday, Humble Bundle and Steam Sale just ensure that the shame pile will never go down. But where do you start? That question will not be answered here. Tune into our first podcast to find our suggestions. Instead, I am going to suggest some healthier drink/food options to get you through your play session.It really can be easy to reach for sugary sodas or carb loaded snacks when you are putting hours into a game. Iâ€™m got as much cred as a doctor as Super Mario does (seriously who goes to a plumber for pills? Sounds shifty), so donâ€™t rely too much on my advice.  Water Staying hydrated is key to not passing out and falling out of your chair onto the floor (which is lava)  Coffee If you are trying to stay alert, at least you can control the amount of sugar that goes into it.  Baby carrots If it was good enough for you at age 6, itâ€™s good enough for you now. Broccoli or any other crunchy veggie with guacamole might help you get that satisfying crunch instead of reaching for the pringles can (your hand is going to get stuck trying to reach for the chips anyway. Letâ€™s avoid the horrifying ordeal)  Burgers and fries Seriously can still be an option. If you are craving meat when slicing beasts up in the fields of Hyrule, stick to lean options like 96% lean beef or bison. Using an air fryer to make French fries can reduce the amount of oil you are cooking with while still maintaining that glorious fried flavor.  Pizza You can bake your own with olive oil instead of tomato sauce. Goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms are some healthy topping options.So those are some healthy suggestions to get you through your play session. Now excuse me, I think my Postmates order is here. Mmmm bacon fries, mac and cheese, fried chicken and Mountain Dew.",

			 "content": "Find out if these games are good enough for you and your friends before spending your cold hard cash. As you go through this blog, youâ€™ll notice a trend in my game selection. For most of this collection (with a few exceptions), Iâ€™ve pulled together a list of games with a low cost to high replayability ratio.This was done with the intention of maximizing enjoyment for you and your friends while keeping your money where it belongs, in your wallet. Thatâ€™s why I leaned towards games that are procedurally generated with some sort of progression system and a timeless artstyle for almost infinite replayability.CrawlGrab your friends and battle through randomly generated dungeons. Become horrid beasts and control traps to kill the hero. Race to buy weapons and reach level 10 so you can kill the boss, before your friends kill you!Stick Fight: The GameYou donâ€™t have to be a great gamer to enjoy this fighting game. A physics-based combat system where you punch, kick, slice, and shoot to take out your aggression the old fashion way. By beating your friends in video games until they run home crying to their mommy. With over 100 interactive levels and procedural generated animations, youâ€™ll never have a dull moment.For The KingA low-poly procedurally generated table top strategy game with a multiclass progression system. Travel the world together, voyage the seas, explore dungeons, win challenges, discover loot, avoid traps, and beat the odds in the unforgiving lands of Fahrul.PyreSupergiants first multiplayer game does not disappoint. Pyre uses an impressive visual style with memorable voice-over work and ear melting music. Beyond the surface features, Pyre is a crossroad between fantasy adventure, action RPG, and graphic novel. Teams are placed at opposite ends of a small map, each with a flame. Your goal is to grab a ball of energy, throw it into the enemy flame until the enemy teamâ€™s pyre has been extinguished.Magicka 2If you love light hearted humor that enjoys making fun of itself, than youâ€™ll love playing this stupid storyline. Play with your imaginary friends, combine real magic, and bear witness to special effects like those only seen in this video game. Progress through not the seven kingdoms, kill not vampires, and read words until your heartâ€™s content. Overall itâ€™s a pretty fun games that is moderately difficult yet easy enough for casual gamers to enjoy.Moon HuntersA beautiful 2D role play game, with an amazing soundtrack that lets you write your own adventure. Explore a randomly generated Mesopotamia-inspired world with your friends, in a Zelda / Diablo hybrid of sorts. Each player has unique powers and abilities that you can use to help each other while you explore the world, survive off the land, and play the many quest in the game.N++A seizure inducing minimalist platformer that ends friendships with its local competitive multiplayer. Use the built-in level editor with 50+ color schemes and what feels like an infinite number of templates. This platformer give super meatboy a run for its money.CupheadUnless youâ€™ve been living under a rock for the past 2 years, you heard about Cuphead. The weird, beautifully drawn shooter game designed to look like an early Walt Disney cartoon with a jazz soundtrack to match. Itâ€™s on sale right now, so if you havenâ€™t bought it, you probably should.Street of RogueA procedurally generated cities game that uses RPG elements in order to progress the player, so there is a sense of accomplishment after missions. Build up special character traits, items, and the environment with your friends in this couch multiplayer rogue-lite action RPG.ClashlandsPrepare for the story of a lifetime, with a bad guy, a bunch of quest, a purple hero, and itâ€™s gender neutral friend. Kill local wildlife to acquire their parts for your crafting, then turn their own parts against them. Sew their skin into armor, grind their bones into weapons, and turn their babies against their former family by having them fight for their new mothers enjoyment.",
